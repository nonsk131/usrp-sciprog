Sam Cabot was created in stardate 9508 on the planet Zircon. His family was forced to flee the planet when the host star went supernova. They barely escaped on an experimental warp drive spacecraft as the resulting black hole consumed their home planet. En route to the intergalactic relocation site, quantum fluctuations in the baryonic gauge capacitor sent craft into a worm hole, separating everyone on board. Sam was shortly recovered in the Solar System several years ago, on the outskirts of the Oort cloud. He has since found a home on Earth.
