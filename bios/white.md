Natalie Diaz grew up in the one and only 703 (Northern Virginia woohoo). She has a younger sister, Linda, and a hermit crab, Kitty. She loves music, books, and sunny days. Sheâ€™s thrilled to be a part of USRP this summer and is excited to learn some astrophysics. Ad astra! 

Hansheng Chen was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, China. He came to the United States in 2013 to begin his undergraduate study in Illinois Wesleyan University. He's excited to participate in USRP 2016 and to learn more about astrophysics research through this summer program.

Carlos Anicetti was born in Vallejo, California, on 25 March 1997. He now lives in Tiburon. In addition to astrophysics, he enjoys volunteering at his local observatory, jogging, Roman history, and utterly failing to play video games with any sort of proficiency. He has a cat, who really more owns him rather than the other way around. He is quite excited for USRP.
