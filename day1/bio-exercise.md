# Team bio exercise

To practice using git/Github, each team should collaboratively write a team bio, as follows:

* **One** member of each team should fork this `usrp-sciprog` repository and add all team members as collaborators (go to the 'settings' area of the repository on Github)---this will allow everyone on the team to have push access.
* Everyone on the team should now clone this fork to their local machine.  
* Create a team bio file under the `bios` directory, called, e.g., `green.md`.  Keep the files in markdown format (that's what the .md means); that way they look nice on Github.
* Everyone on the team should write his/her own paragraph (see the [organizers' bio](../bios/organizers.md) for inspiration).  Push/pull frequently, and figure out (or ask!) how to deal with merge conflicts if they aris* When you have a finished bio on your team's fork, then submit a pull request to the main repository.
